History:
    Sept 6th 2021
        - trying to fix structure so we allow a single left click and any number of rc...
        - first we have to register
        - made a blob class that stories associated data
        - create content cells at the beginning.
        - refactored so that we can handle right clicks     
        
    Sept 1st 2021
        - figured out that event.data.originalEvent.which 
            = 3 for right click
            = 1 for left click
